This work applies Canny edge detection algorithm to the image.
The requirements are described in 'project 6 2020-06-01.pdf'.
Executing hw6_0510894.m in MATLAB can obtain the results.

Replace 'image-pj6(Canny).tif' with your input image name in hw6_0510894.m.
```
Img=im2double(imread('image-pj6(Canny).tif'));
```
